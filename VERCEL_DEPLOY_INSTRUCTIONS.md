## 🎯 Deploy to Vercel Now

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - remove conflicting dependencies"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Vercel

**If you already have a Vercel project:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy"

**If creating new project:**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. **Use these EXACT settings:**

```
Framework Preset: Create React App
Root Directory: frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: build
Install Command: npm install
Node.js Version: 18.x
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-render-backend.onrender.com
```
(Replace with your actual Render backend URL)

### Step 3: Deploy
Click "Deploy" and wait for build completion.

## 🔧 If Build Still Fails

### Check Vercel Build Settings
Make sure you have:
- ✅ Root Directory: `frontend`  
- ✅ Build Command: `npm run build`
- ✅ Output Directory: `build`
- ✅ Install Command: `npm install`

### Alternative Build Settings (if needed)
If still getting peer dependency errors, try:
```
Install Command: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

Once successful:
1. ✅ App loads at your Vercel URL
2. ✅ Can register new accounts  
3. ✅ Can login with test credentials
4. ✅ Backend API calls work
5. ✅ Addresses are clickable (Google Maps)

## 📱 Test Credentials

Once deployed, create these accounts or use registration:
- **Donor**: `donor@example.com` / `password123`
- **Recipient**: `recipient@example.com` / `password123`

## ❌ Common Issues & Solutions

**Build Error: "Command failed with exit code 1"**
- Check that `frontend` is set as root directory
- Verify environment variables are set
- Try clearing Vercel build cache

**API calls failing**
- Check `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is correct
- Ensure your Render backend is running
- Test backend health at: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/health`

**App loads but features don't work**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS settings in backend allow your frontend URL
